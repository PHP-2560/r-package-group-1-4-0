Our package will scrape US News university rankings, including the ranking, names, tuition, endowment, year founded, religious affiliation, amongst other aspects.

A dataframe with all US national universities (public and private) will be created, and some visualization (plots, graphs, etc) will also be outputted. 

Since US News rankings change at least annually, this package can be utilized to scrape updated university information.

Each of us will complete the following:
Lucas: 
1. Sentiment analysis with Twitter's API (eg. given a word, how often and in what capacity does that word show up in the sample?)
2. Overall code for scraping data

Kitty:
1. Scraping individual university pages
2. Overall code for scraping data
